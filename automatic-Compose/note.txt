Grafana is a data visualization platform that allows you to create custom dashboards 
to display real-time metrics and data. It's commonly used for:

Visualizing time-series data
Creating dashboards to monitor application and system performance
Displaying charts and tables to analyze trends and patterns
Prometheus, on the other hand, is a monitoring and alerting system that focuses on collecting metrics from systems and applications. 
It's commonly used for:

Collecting performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network usage
Storing and processing time-series data
Defining alerts and notifications based on specific conditions

Together, Grafana and Prometheus are used to monitor and analyze system and application performance, 
allowing DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) teams to identify issues and optimize performance.
